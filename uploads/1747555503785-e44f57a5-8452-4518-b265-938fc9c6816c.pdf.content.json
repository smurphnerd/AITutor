This strategic initiative is scheduled for completion by\nJune 2026, with a total allocated budget of $1,035,000.\nThe project directly addresses three critical needs identified within the university’s\ndigital infrastructure:\n•Enhanced Cybersecurity Awareness:Through the implementation of a manda-\ntoryCybersecurityAwarenessFrameworkforAcademia(CAFA),theprojectaims\nto strengthen the university’s human firewall against sophisticated and evolving\ncyber threats.\n•Improved Data Management:The deployment of a Master Data Management\n(MDM) solution will enhance data quality, reduce operational redundancy, and\nensure consistent, reliable information across diverse university systems.\n•Strengthened Security Compliance:Completion of an Australian Cyber Secu-\nrity Centre (ACSC) Essential Eight audit and subsequent remediation activities\nwill validate and improve the university’s technical security posture against rec-\nognized national standards.\nThisinitiativewaspromptedbyseveralkeyfactors, includingtheincreasingsophis-\ntication of cyber threats targeting educational institutions, the growing complexity of\nmanaging data across numerous university systems, evolving regulatory requirements\nfor robust cybersecurity measures, and the clear need for standardized cybersecurity\nawareness among all staff and students.\nThe Cybersecurity and Data Governance Improvement project aligns with Monash\nUniversity’s overarching commitment to digital excellence, operational resilience, and\ncomprehensive data security, while ensuring compliance with national cybersecurity\nstandards. The successful planning and execution of quality management and stake-\nholder engagement, as detailed herein, are critical to achieving the project’s goal of\nsignificantly enhancing the university’s cyber resilience and data governance capabil-\nities.\n1\n\n1\nProject Quality Management\n1.1Quality Requirement #1 - CAFA Effectiveness and Usabil-\nity\nQuality ObjectiveTo ensure the Cybersecurity Awareness Framework for Academia\n(CAFA) program, including the CATM training modules integrated with the Monash\nLMS, effectively improves cybersecurity knowledge among staff and students, and is\nhighly usable and accessible.\nQuality StandardsTwo primary quality standards guide this objective:\n•ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Annex A Control 6.3 (Information security awareness,\neducation and training)(International Organization for Standardization, 2022).\nThis framework ensures personnel understand information security threats and\nresponsibilities, guiding the relevance and comprehensiveness of CATM content.\n•Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA(W3C Web Ac-\ncessibility Initiative (WAI), 2023). This standard will be applied to CATMs and\ntheir LMS interface.\nJustificationISO 27001 alignment ensures CAFA content addresses pertinent univer-\nsity cybersecurity threats and compliance needs, tackling specific risks like phishing\n(Alharbi & Tassaddiq, 2021;Khader et al., 2021) and addressing the problem of in-\nadequate awareness. WCAG 2.2 AA compliance is vital for Monash as an inclusive\ninstitution, ensuring training materials are perceivable, operable, understandable, and\nrobust for users with disabilities. This promotes equitable access, maximizing reach\nand effectiveness. Poorly designed or inaccessible modules would significantly hinder\nuser engagement and the 90% completion target. These standards ensure CAFA is both\nmeaningful and universally deliverable.\n2\n\n1.1. Quality Requirement #1 - CAFA Effectiveness and Usability3\nAssumptions\n•TheCybersecurityAwarenessCenter(CAC)possessesexpertisetovalidateCATM\ncontent relevance against ISO 27001.\n•The Monash LMS platform supports WCAG 2.2 AA compliant module delivery\nand accurate user tracking for metrics.\n•A representative user sample will be available for pilot testing to validate usabil-\nity and knowledge improvement metrics.\nMetrics and Measurement Methods\n•Metric 1: Training Completion Rate:\n–Measure:Percentageofassignedstaff/studentscompletingmandatoryCATMs.\n–Source:LMS tracking.\n–Target:≥90% by December 31, 2026.\n•Metric 2: User Satisfaction Score:\n–Measure:Average score from post-module surveys (5-point Likert scale) as-\nsessing relevance, clarity, ease of use, accessibility.\n–Source:Embedded LMS surveys.\n–Target:≥4.0/5.0 average across modules by end of initial rollout (Q1 2026).\n•Metric 3: Knowledge Assessment Score Improvement:\n–Measure:Average percentage improvement between pre-module quiz and\npost-module assessment scores.\n–Source:Pilot phase testing.\n–Target:≥30% improvement on key concepts (Q3 2025).\n•Metric 4: WCAG 2.2 AA Conformance:\n–Measure:Percentage of WCAG 2.2 Level AA success criteria met.\n–Source:Automated tools (e.g., WAVE, Axe) and manual audits by Test Ana-\nlyst.\n–Target:100% conformance for all CATMs prior to deployment.\nMonitoring and Review Process\n•Oversight:Project Manager and contracted Test Analyst oversee CAFA quality.\nThe CAC board will be consulted on content alignment with ISO 27001 during\nscheduled reviews.\n•Compliance & Usability Testing:Test Analyst conducts WCAG checks and us-\nability testing during module development (Q2-Q3 2025).\n•Ongoing Monitoring:\n–User satisfaction and completion rates: Monitored monthly via LMS reports\nfrom program rollout (Q1 2026).\n–Knowledge assessment scores: Analyzed post-pilot phase (end Q3 2025).\n•Review Meetings:Monthly quality reviews (PM, Test Analyst, Content Writer,\nCAC representative) to discuss metrics, feedback, and deviations.\n\n41. Project Quality Management\n•Corrective Action:Issues (e.g., low satisfaction, accessibility barriers, content\nmisalignment) trigger review and revision of CATMs/interface using a PDCA\ncycle.\n1.2Quality Requirement #2 - MDM Data Quality, Reliability,\nand Eﬀiciency\nQuality ObjectiveTo ensure the MDM solution establishes high data quality (accu-\nracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness) for critical domains, ensures high system\navailability, and achieves a 10% reduction in data management costs by end of 2026.\nQuality StandardsThis objective will be guided by two key frameworks:\n•DAMA-DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge) framework, specif-\nically its Data Quality and Data Architecture knowledge areas (DAMA Interna-\ntional, 2017). This informs data quality rules, stewardship, and architectural de-\nsign, promoting a view of data as an asset.\n•ISO 8000-110:2019 (Data quality – Part 110: Master data)principles for master\ndata exchange, characteristic data syntax, semantic encoding, and conformance\n(International Organization for Standardization, 2019). This guides structuring\nand validation of master data entities for clarity and interoperability.\nJustificationDAMA-DMBOK principles provide a structured approach to data gov-\nernance, addressing fragmented data practices (Schmuck et al., 2024) and building a\nfoundation for reliable data crucial for university operations and reporting. ISO 8000\nprinciples ensure MDM-managed core data entities are well-defined and conformant.\nThis is essential for automated validation, error reduction, and reliable data exchange,\ndirectly supporting operational eﬀiciency and cost reduction. High system reliability\nis also paramount; MDM hub downtime would disrupt dependent university systems.\nAssumptions\n•Business units will commit to standardized master data definitions and quality\nrules necessary for achieving target metrics.\n•The Informatica MDM platform’s data quality tools are adequate for measuring\nand monitoring the defined data quality metrics.\n•Baseline data for 2024 data management operational expenditures is accurate for\nmeasuring cost reduction.\nMetrics and Measurement Methods\n•Metric 1: Data Quality Score (Composite Index):Calculated quarterly from au-\ntomated MDM hub profiling. The 20% improvement target applies to this overall\nindex derived from sub-metrics.\n\n1.2. Quality Requirement #2 - MDM Data Quality, Reliability, and Eﬀiciency5\n–Sub-Metric 1a: Completeness:Target≥98% for defined critical data elements\n(e.g., student records: student ID, legal name; staff records: employee ID,\nprimary department).\n–Sub-Metric 1b: Consistency:Target≥95% match rate for key identifiers across\nintegrated systems.\n–Sub-Metric 1c: Timeliness:Target<24 hours latency for critical data updates\nto the MDM hub.\n–Overall Target:20% improvement in the composite index score from baseline\n(Q2 2025) by project end (Q2 2026).\n•Metric 2: System Availability:\n–Measure:Percentage uptime of the core MDM platform (excluding planned\nmaintenance).\n–Source:Monitored by Monash IT Operations post-handover.\n–Target:≥99.5% availability (starting Q2 2026).\n•Metric 3: Data Management Cost Reduction:\n–Measure:Comparison of 2026 actual data management operational expen-\nditures (incl. MDM maintenance) against the 2024 baseline (~$5.84M), ad-\njusted for inflation if needed.\n–Source:Annual financial reports.\n–Target:≥10% reduction by December 31, 2026.\nMonitoring and Review Process\n•Oversight:Project Manager, supported by contracted Data Architect, GRC Con-\nsultant, and Senior Test Analyst.\n•Automated Monitoring:Data quality profiling tools (Informatica) provide con-\ntinuous monitoring, with reports reviewed quarterly.\n•Validation:Senior Test Analyst validates system functionality and integration\nreliability during implementation (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026).\n•Operational Monitoring:System availability monitored by Monash IT Opera-\ntions post-handover. Cost reduction tracked annually by PM with Monash Fi-\nnance.\n•Review Meetings:Quarterly MDM quality reviews to assess metrics against tar-\ngets.\n•Corrective Action:Significant deviations (e.g., data quality score drops, low\navailability)triggerrootcauseanalysisbytechnicalteamanddatastewards, lead-\ning to corrective actions (e.g., refining data rules, adjusting integrations, system\noptimization).\n\n2\nProject Stakeholder and\nCommunication Management\n2.1Stakeholder Register\nTable 2.1:Stakeholder Register\nNo. NameTitleRole in ProjectContact\n1 Sharon Pickering\n(She/Her)\nVice Chancellor, Monash\nUniversity\nProject Sponsorsharon.pickering\n@monash.edu,\n+61399012345\n2 Dan Maslin\n(He/Him)\nGroup Chief Information\nSecurity Oﬀicer (CISO),\nMonash University\nKey Internal Stakeholder\n(Operational Security\nLead, Policy Endorse-\nment)\ndan.maslin\n@monash.edu,\n+61412345678\n3 Josh Teichman\n(He/Him)\nChief Transformation Of-\nficer and Acting Execu-\ntive Director, eSolutions,\nMonash University\nKey Internal Stakeholder\n(Oversees eSolutions,\nstrategic alignment of tech\ninitiatives)\njosh.teichman\n@monash.edu,\n+61423456789\n4 Sean Murphy\n(He/Him)\nIT Project Manager,\nMonash University\nProject Managersmur0055 @stu-\ndent.monash.edu,\n+61434567890\n5 Siddhant Tandon\n(He/Him)\nDirector, Information &\nRecords Management,\nMonash University (eSo-\nlutions)\nKey Internal Stakeholder\n(Data Governance, Infor-\nmation Policy Owner)\nsiddhant.tandon\n@monash.edu,\n+61401234567\nContinued on next page\n6\n\n2.1.

Engagement Strategy13\n2.3Engagement Strategy\n2.3.1Dan Maslin (He/Him) – Group Chief Information Security Oﬀicer\n(CISO), Monash University\n•Power Level:High\n•Interest Level:High\n•Current Engagement:Supportive (but discerning)\n•Engagement Strategy:Dan is an experienced and pragmatic CISO with deep techni-\ncal understanding, values data-driven arguments and concise information. Engage-\nment will focus on providing him with executive-level monthly status reports on\nrisk posture and ACSC progress. Direct access to technical leads will be offered for\noptional deep dives, respecting his busy schedule. We will actively seek his strategic\ninput on ACSC remediation priorities, leveraging his expertise. For the MDM secu-\nrity architecture, his delegates will be involved in technical reviews, with summary\nendorsements provided to him. This approach aims to maintain his confidence by\nshowing competence, proactive risk management, and alignment with his goal of\npractical, eﬀicient risk reduction without operational friction. Regular, transparent\nupdates on challenges will ensure he remains well-informed and engaged.\n•Conflict Management Approach:\n–Address disagreements on priorities or technical approaches with evidence-\nbased arguments, referencing ACSC guidelines and risk assessments, acknowl-\nedging his need for strong justification.\n–Facilitate direct discussions between Dan’s team and project technical leads if\nspecific technical solutions are questioned.\n–Document significant strategic disagreements on risk acceptance, including dif-\nfering viewpoints, and escalate to the Project Sponsor via the Steering Commit-\ntee with a clear recommendation, ensuring his expert opinion is represented.\n–Maintain transparency about project challenges and risks to build trust and\navoid surprises.\n2.3.2Sasha Braybrooke (She/Her) – President, Monash Student Associa-\ntion (MSA)\n•Power Level:Medium\n•Interest Level:High\n•Current Engagement:Neutral (Needs proactive engagement)\n•Engagement Strategy:Sasha is a passionate advocate for student welfare, valuing\ntransparency and genuine consultation. Engagement will begin with a briefing to\nexplaintheCAFAinitiative’sstudentimpact, emphasizingapartnership. Communi-\ncations will be jargon-free, focusing onwhyCAFA is important fortheirdata security\nand online safety. We will utilize MSA channels for outreach, co-developing content.\nHer or an MSA delegate’s participation in CAFA pilot feedback sessions will be cru-\n\n142. Project Stakeholder and Communication Management\ncial for gathering insights on usability, relevance (especially concerning mandatory\ntraining and privacy), and accessibility. This feedback will visibly inform module\nimprovements. The goal is to make Sasha an ally who can effectively communicate\nthe program’s benefits to students, addressing their concerns proactively.\n•Conflict Management Approach:\n–Proactivelyaddressanticipatedstudentconcerns(e.g., mandatorytrainingtime,\nprivacy) in initial communications and FAQs.\n–Listen actively if specific issues are raised via MSA (e.g., module length, rele-\nvance) and schedule meetings to explore feasible adjustments while explaining\nconstraints.\n–Engage collaboratively to find solutions for broader student pushback, empha-\nsizing the necessity of cyber awareness while remaining flexible on implemen-\ntation details where possible.\n–Ensure that feedback mechanisms are clear and that students feel their concerns\nare acknowledged, even if not all requests can be accommodated.\n\nReferences\nAlharbi, T., & Tassaddiq, A.
