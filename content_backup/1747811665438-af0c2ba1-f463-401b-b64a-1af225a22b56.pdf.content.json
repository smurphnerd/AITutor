Project\nOverview\nThis document outlines the\nQuality\nManagement\nPlan and the\nStakeholder and\nCom- munication\nManagement\nPlan for\nMonash\nUniversity’s\nCybersecurity and\nData\nGov- ernance\nImprovement project. This strategic initiative is scheduled for completion by\nJune 2026, with a total allocated budget of $1,035,000. The project directly addresses three critical needs identified within the university’s digital infrastructure: * Enhanced\nCybersecurity\nAwareness:Through the implementation of a manda- toryCybersecurityAwarenessFrameworkforAcademia(CAFA),theprojectaims to strengthen the university’s human firewall against sophisticated and evolving cyber threats. * Improved\nData\nManagement:The deployment of a\nMaster\nData\nManagement (MDM) solution will enhance data quality, reduce operational redundancy, and ensure consistent, reliable information across diverse university systems. * Strengthened\nSecurity\nCompliance:Completion of an\nAustralian\nCyber\nSecu- rity\nCentre (ACSC) Essential\nEight audit and subsequent remediation activities will validate and improve the university’s technical security posture against rec- ognized national standards. Thisinitiativewaspromptedbyseveralkeyfactors, includingtheincreasingsophis- tication of cyber threats targeting educational institutions, the growing complexity of managing data across numerous university systems, evolving regulatory requirements for robust cybersecurity measures, and the clear need for standardized cybersecurity awareness among all staff and students. The\nCybersecurity and\nData\nGovernance\nImprovement project aligns with\nMonash\nUniversity’s overarching commitment to digital excellence, operational resilience, and comprehensive data security, while ensuring compliance with national cybersecurity standards. The successful planning and execution of quality management and stake- holder engagement, as detailed herein, are critical to achieving the project’s goal of significantly enhancing the university’s cyber resilience and data governance capabil- ities. 1 1 Project\nQuality\nManagement 1.1Quality\nRequirement #1 - CAFA Effectiveness and\nUsabil- ity\nQuality\nObjectiveTo ensure the\nCybersecurity\nAwareness\nFramework for\nAcademia (CAFA) program, including the\nCATM training modules integrated with the\nMonash\nLMS, effectively improves cybersecurity knowledge among staff and students, and is highly usable and accessible. Quality\nStandardsTwo primary quality standards guide this objective: * ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Annex\nA Control 6.3 (Information security awareness, education and training)(International\nOrganization for\nStandardization, 2022). This framework ensures personnel understand information security threats and responsibilities, guiding the relevance and comprehensiveness of\nCATM content. * Web\nContent\nAccessibility\nGuidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level\nAA(W3C Web\nAc- cessibility\nInitiative (WAI), 2023). This standard will be applied to\nCATMs and their\nLMS interface. JustificationISO 27001 alignment ensures\nCAFA content addresses pertinent univer- sity cybersecurity threats and compliance needs, tackling specific risks like phishing (Alharbi & Tassaddiq, 2021;Khader et al., 2021) and addressing the problem of in- adequate awareness. WCAG 2.2 AA compliance is vital for\nMonash as an inclusive institution, ensuring training materials are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for users with disabilities. This promotes equitable access, maximizing reach and effectiveness. Poorly designed or inaccessible modules would significantly hinder user engagement and the 90% completion target. These standards ensure\nCAFA is both meaningful and universally deliverable. 2 1.1. Quality\nRequirement #1 - CAFA Effectiveness and\nUsability3 Assumptions * TheCybersecurityAwarenessCenter(CAC)possessesexpertisetovalidateCATM content relevance against\nISO 27001. * The\nMonash\nLMS platform supports\nWCAG 2.2 AA compliant module delivery and accurate user tracking for metrics. * A representative user sample will be available for pilot testing to validate usabil- ity and knowledge improvement metrics. Metrics and\nMeasurement\nMethods * Metric 1: Training\nCompletion\nRate: –Measure:Percentageofassignedstaff/studentscompletingmandatoryCATMs. –Source:LMS tracking. –Target:≥90% by\nDecember 31, 2026. * Metric 2: User\nSatisfaction\nScore: –Measure:Average score from post-module surveys (5-point\nLikert scale) as- sessing relevance, clarity, ease of use, accessibility. –Source:Embedded\nLMS surveys. –Target:≥4.0/5.0 average across modules by end of initial rollout (Q1 2026). * Metric 3: Knowledge\nAssessment\nScore\nImprovement: –Measure:Average percentage improvement between pre-module quiz and post-module assessment scores. –Source:Pilot phase testing. –Target:≥30% improvement on key concepts (Q3 2025). * Metric 4: WCAG 2.2 AA Conformance: –Measure:Percentage of\nWCAG 2.2 Level\nAA success criteria met. –Source:Automated tools (e.g., WAVE, Axe) and manual audits by\nTest\nAna- lyst. –Target:100% conformance for all\nCATMs prior to deployment. Monitoring and\nReview\nProcess * Oversight:Project\nManager and contracted\nTest\nAnalyst oversee\nCAFA quality. The\nCAC board will be consulted on content alignment with\nISO 27001 during scheduled reviews. * Compliance & Usability\nTesting:Test\nAnalyst conducts\nWCAG checks and us- ability testing during module development (Q2-Q3 2025). * Ongoing\nMonitoring: –User satisfaction and completion rates: Monitored monthly via\nLMS reports from program rollout (Q1 2026). –Knowledge assessment scores: Analyzed post-pilot phase (end\nQ3 2025). * Review\nMeetings:Monthly quality reviews (PM, Test\nAnalyst, Content\nWriter, CAC representative) to discuss metrics, feedback, and deviations. 41. Project\nQuality\nManagement * Corrective\nAction:Issues (e.g., low satisfaction, accessibility barriers, content misalignment) trigger review and revision of\nCATMs/interface using a\nPDCA cycle. 1.2Quality\nRequirement #2 - MDM Data\nQuality, Reliability, and\nEﬀiciency\nQuality\nObjectiveTo ensure the\nMDM solution establishes high data quality (accu- racy, completeness, consistency, timeliness) for critical domains, ensures high system availability, and achieves a 10% reduction in data management costs by end of 2026. Quality\nStandardsThis objective will be guided by two key frameworks: * DAMA-DMBOK (Data\nManagement\nBody of\nKnowledge) framework, specif- ically its\nData\nQuality and\nData\nArchitecture knowledge areas (DAMA Interna- tional, 2017). This informs data quality rules, stewardship, and architectural de- sign, promoting a view of data as an asset. * ISO 8000-110:2019 (Data quality – Part 110: Master data)principles for master data exchange, characteristic data syntax, semantic encoding, and conformance (International\nOrganization for\nStandardization, 2019). This guides structuring and validation of master data entities for clarity and interoperability. JustificationDAMA-DMBOK principles provide a structured approach to data gov- ernance, addressing fragmented data practices (Schmuck et al., 2024) and building a foundation for reliable data crucial for university operations and reporting. ISO 8000 principles ensure\nMDM-managed core data entities are well-defined and conformant. This is essential for automated validation, error reduction, and reliable data exchange, directly supporting operational eﬀiciency and cost reduction. High system reliability is also paramount; MDM hub downtime would disrupt dependent university systems. Assumptions * Business units will commit to standardized master data definitions and quality rules necessary for achieving target metrics. * The\nInformatica\nMDM platform’s data quality tools are adequate for measuring and monitoring the defined data quality metrics. * Baseline data for 2024 data management operational expenditures is accurate for measuring cost reduction. Metrics and\nMeasurement\nMethods * Metric 1: Data\nQuality\nScore (Composite\nIndex):Calculated quarterly from au- tomated\nMDM hub profiling. The 20% improvement target applies to this overall index derived from sub-metrics. 1.2. Quality\nRequirement #2 - MDM Data\nQuality, Reliability, and\nEﬀiciency5 –Sub-Metric 1a: Completeness:Target≥98% for defined critical data elements (e.g., student records: student\nID, legal name; staff records: employee\nID, primary department). –Sub-Metric 1b: Consistency:Target≥95% match rate for key identifiers across integrated systems. –Sub-Metric 1c: Timeliness:Target<24 hours latency for critical data updates to the\nMDM hub. –Overall\nTarget:20% improvement in the composite index score from baseline (Q2 2025) by project end (Q2 2026). * Metric 2: System\nAvailability: –Measure:Percentage uptime of the core\nMDM platform (excluding planned maintenance). –Source:Monitored by\nMonash\nIT Operations post-handover. –Target:≥99.5% availability (starting\nQ2 2026). * Metric 3: Data\nManagement\nCost\nReduction: –Measure:Comparison of 2026 actual data management operational expen- ditures (incl. MDM maintenance) against the 2024 baseline (~$5.84M), ad- justed for inflation if needed. –Source:Annual financial reports. –Target:≥10% reduction by\nDecember 31, 2026. Monitoring and\nReview\nProcess * Oversight:Project\nManager, supported by contracted\nData\nArchitect, GRC Con- sultant, and\nSenior\nTest\nAnalyst. * Automated\nMonitoring:Data quality profiling tools (Informatica) provide con- tinuous monitoring, with reports reviewed quarterly. * Validation:Senior\nTest\nAnalyst validates system functionality and integration reliability during implementation (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026). * Operational\nMonitoring:System availability monitored by\nMonash\nIT Opera- tions post-handover. Cost reduction tracked annually by\nPM with\nMonash\nFi- nance. * Review\nMeetings:Quarterly\nMDM quality reviews to assess metrics against tar- gets. * Corrective\nAction:Significant deviations (e.g., data quality score drops, low availability)triggerrootcauseanalysisbytechnicalteamanddatastewards, lead- ing to corrective actions (e.g., refining data rules, adjusting integrations, system optimization). 2 Project\nStakeholder and\nCommunication\nManagement 2.1Stakeholder\nRegister\nTable 2.1:Stakeholder\nRegister\nNo. NameTitleRole in\nProjectContact 1 Sharon\nPickering (She/Her) Vice\nChancellor, Monash\nUniversity\nProject\nSponsorsharon.pickering @monash.edu, +61399012345 2 Dan\nMaslin (He/Him) Group\nChief\nInformation\nSecurity\nOﬀicer (CISO), Monash\nUniversity\nKey\nInternal\nStakeholder (Operational\nSecurity\nLead, Policy\nEndorse- ment) dan.maslin @monash.edu, +61412345678 3 Josh\nTeichman (He/Him) Chief\nTransformation\nOf- ficer and\nActing\nExecu- tive\nDirector, eSolutions, Monash\nUniversity\nKey\nInternal\nStakeholder (Oversees eSolutions, strategic alignment of tech initiatives) josh.teichman @monash.edu, +61423456789 4 Sean\nMurphy (He/Him) IT Project\nManager, Monash\nUniversity\nProject\nManagersmur0055 @stu- dent.monash.edu, +61434567890 5 Siddhant\nTandon (He/Him) Director, Information & Records\nManagement, Monash\nUniversity (eSo- lutions) Key\nInternal\nStakeholder (Data\nGovernance, Infor- mation\nPolicy\nOwner) siddhant.tandon @monash.edu, +61401234567 Continued on next page 6 2.1.

Engage- ment will focus on providing him with executive-level monthly status reports on risk posture and\nACSC progress. Direct access to technical leads will be offered for optional deep dives, respecting his busy schedule. We will actively seek his strategic input on\nACSC remediation priorities, leveraging his expertise. For the\nMDM secu- rity architecture, his delegates will be involved in technical reviews, with summary endorsements provided to him. This approach aims to maintain his confidence by showing competence, proactive risk management, and alignment with his goal of practical, eﬀicient risk reduction without operational friction. Regular, transparent updates on challenges will ensure he remains well-informed and engaged. * Conflict\nManagement\nApproach: –Address disagreements on priorities or technical approaches with evidence- based arguments, referencing\nACSC guidelines and risk assessments, acknowl- edging his need for strong justification. –Facilitate direct discussions between\nDan’s team and project technical leads if specific technical solutions are questioned. –Document significant strategic disagreements on risk acceptance, including dif- fering viewpoints, and escalate to the\nProject\nSponsor via the\nSteering\nCommit- tee with a clear recommendation, ensuring his expert opinion is represented. –Maintain transparency about project challenges and risks to build trust and avoid surprises. 2.3.2Sasha\nBraybrooke (She/Her) – President, Monash\nStudent\nAssocia- tion (MSA) * Power\nLevel:Medium * Interest\nLevel:High * Current\nEngagement:Neutral (Needs proactive engagement) * Engagement\nStrategy:Sasha is a passionate advocate for student welfare, valuing transparency and genuine consultation. Engagement will begin with a briefing to explaintheCAFAinitiative’sstudentimpact, emphasizingapartnership. Communi- cations will be jargon-free, focusing onwhyCAFA is important fortheirdata security and online safety. We will utilize\nMSA channels for outreach, co-developing content.
